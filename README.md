# ThermalSpringsAndSubwayBenches

Expanded, full-sized versions of select figures from the 2022 thesis:  
  
**FROM THERMAL SPRINGS TO SUBWAY BENCHES: EXPLORING THE DIVERSITY OF CARBON MONOXIDE DEHYDROGENASES THROUGH METAGENOMES, PHYLOGENETICS, AND MACHINE LEARNING**  
  
are available here. In .pdf format, they can be easily magnified and navigated to more fully explore the diversity of anaerobic CODHs.

#### Figure 9
Phylogenetic tree of CooS/Cdh protein sequences. Tree tips and outer ring are colored by the clade assigned to the sequence by Inoue et al. (2019) where applicable. As a result, only grounding sequences are colored. Branches are colored by branch support reported by FastTree. NA represents sequences that were not previously used in the Inoue et al. (2019) tree and thus were not previously assigned to a clade. Branch supports are shown by a gradient of branch colors, with black representing 100% branch support and red representing 0% branch support.

#### Figure 10
Phylogenetic tree of CooS/Cdh protein sequences. Tree tips and outer ring are colored by the taxonomy assigned to sequence’s source MAG at the phylum level. Taxonony of MAGs was assigned using the GTDB taxonomic classification scheme. Branch supports are shown by a gradient of branch colors, with black representing 100% branch support and red representing 0%  branch support.

#### Figure 11
Phylogenetic tree of CooS/Cdh protein sequences. Tree tips and outer ring are colored by modified GOLD ecosystem category label (Environ) assigned to the sequence’s source MAG. Branch supports are shown by a gradient of branch colors, with black representing 100% branch support and red representing 0% branch support.
